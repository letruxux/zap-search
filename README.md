Facing some issues? Try [running it locally](#run-locally).

## Run locally

> Executable releases may be out of date, if you want to run the latest version, you can use the hosted version or [run it in development](RUN.md#run-in-development) (or [with docker](RUN.md#run-with-docker)).

- Download the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/letruxux/zap-search/releases) page.
- Extract the archive to a folder.
- Run the executable.
- Don't move the dist folder or the executable away: they must be in the same folder.
