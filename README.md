# Run locally

> [!CAUTION]
> Instead of using the .zip archive, please [download the source](https://github.com/letruxux/zap-search/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and run `compile.bat` to compile the project. A `dist.zip` archive will be created, which is the program.
> This is a temporary fix to an issue with the built archive provided in the release, still investigating.

- Download the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/letruxux/zap-search/releases) page.
- Extract the archive to a folder.
- Run the executable.
- Don't move the dist folder or the executable away: they must be in the same folder.
